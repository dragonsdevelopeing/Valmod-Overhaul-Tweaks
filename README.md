**A word on Random World Generation & Biomes**
While using this mod you will notice smoother biome transitions, medium and large hills with smooth inclines and declines, much smoother biome placement and more natural snowy peaks. Biomes have been changed for increased density of rocks and resources and for some biomes increased amounts trees and plants for a more natural expierence. Changes specific to the way biomes are generated and placed are abundent which make it too hard too list if you are interested in these changes I suggest comparing the relevant files to the untouched versions.

For example you may come across new sub-biomes and snowberries have been placed exclusively in snowy biomes while blueberries are abundent in forest areas.






#Todo-List
- [x] Update the Readme to reflect the many things!
- [ ] Tweak Terrain Mountain Generation so they are more spread out.
- [x] Create Dense Forest Sub-Biome
- [ ] Tweak Terrain Water Placement for slightly larger bodies of water but not too much.
